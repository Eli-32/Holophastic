        <h1>Holophasic Resonance</h1>
        <p>This is a visual representation of a system where every point is interconnected.</p>
        <p>Instead of separate objects, you see a unified field of relational dynamics.</p>
        <p>Click and drag to influence the particle field. Observe how the system responds to your touch.</p>

            <h2>Welcome to the Holophasic Resonance Visualizer</h2>
            <p>This is not just a screensaver. It's a window into a simulated universe where everything is connected.</p>

            <h2>The Particle Field</h2>
            <p>You see hundreds of particles, each moving according to simple rules. But they are not alone.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Interconnections</h2>
            <p>Lines are drawn between nearby particles, representing their relationships. The closer they are, the stronger the connection.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Your Influence</h2>
            <p>Click and drag your mouse. You are not just pushing particles; you are introducing potential into the system, and the entire field reacts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Emergent Behavior</h2>
            <p>Complex patterns and behaviors emerge from these simple interactions. This is the essence of holophasic resonance.</p>
